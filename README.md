You will need to create a JSON file named `creds.json` in the cloned repo. This will contain the `app_key` and `app_id` needed for the Oxford Dictionary API. To retrieve your values, create an account and application at the [OxfordDictionary website](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/). Once you've created your application, get your `app_key` and `app_id` from the API Credentials page.

```json
{
  "app_key": "APP KEY GOES HERE",
  "app_id": "APP ID GOES HERE"
}
```
